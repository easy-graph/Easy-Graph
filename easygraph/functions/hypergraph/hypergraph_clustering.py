def hypergraph_clustering_coefficient(H):
    r"""Return the clustering coefficients for
    each node in a Hypergraph.

    This clustering coefficient is defined as the
    clustering coefficient of the unweighted pairwise
    projection of the hypergraph, i.e.,
    :math:`c = A^3_{i,i}/\binom{k}{2},`
    where :math:`A` is the adjacency matrix of the network
    and :math:`k` is the pairwise degree of :math:`i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : Hypergraph
        Hypergraph

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        nodes are keys, clustering coefficients are values.

    Notes
    -----
    The clustering coefficient is undefined when the number of
    neighbors is 0 or 1, but we set the clustering coefficient
    to 0 in these cases. For more discussion, see
    https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2512
