    r"""Compute the shortest-basic betweenness centrality for nodes.

    .. math::

        c_B(v)  = \sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where V is the set of nodes,

    .. math::
        \sigma(s, t)

    is the number of shortest (s, t)-paths, and

    .. math::

        \sigma(s, t|v)

    is the number of those paths  passing through some node v other than s, t.

    .. math::

        If\ s\ =\ t,\ \sigma(s, t) = 1, and\ if\ v \in {s, t}, \sigma(s, t|v) = 0 [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A easygraph graph.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    sources : None or nodes list, optional (default=None)
      If None, all nodes are considered.
      Otherwise,the set of source vertices to consider when calculating shortest paths.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by `2/((n-1)(n-2))`
      for graphs, and `1/((n-1)(n-2))` for directed graphs where `n`
      is the number of nodes in G.

    endpoints : bool, optional
      If True include the endpoints in the shortest basic counts.

    Returns
    -------

    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.
